* Mondrianify a fixed html site
- empty/don't display elements while keeping their size? 
> janky solution: change text color. doesn't work for images...
> set visibility: hidden
>> problem: may need to make copies of the elements because this will also hide the fill...
- make javascript code with thick black borders between all elements
- choose random color from r,b,y,w for each element and fill blocks
> loop through elements 

- use separate script files
